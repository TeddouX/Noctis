## Reporting a Vulnerability

As Noctis was coded by a beginner in CPP, it may be subject to a lot of vulnerabilities or exploits. 
If you find any, even if it's something really small, feel free to report it in the security tab of this repository
and/or open an issue describing the vulnerabilty for me to fix it as fast as possible.
